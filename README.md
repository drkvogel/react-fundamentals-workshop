Welcome to my React Fundamentals workshop!

To get started, clone this repository (you might want your own fork so you can push your work).

Then run `yarn install`. Each exercise is run individually, so to run an exercise run:

```
yarn run exercise 9
```

Where `9` is the number. This will run that code on port `1234`.
